        operator_to_updated_state(operator, theta_init, phi_init)

        Description:
            - this function takes a quantum operator (corresponding to a qbit gate), and the initial qbit state defined by the angles theta and phi
            - theta and phi define the state based on some point on the bloch sphere in spherical coordinates
            - the statevector of the qbit is defined as [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) * e^(i*phi)]
            - the function returns the state after being acted on by the gate (in terms of the new theta and phi values)

        Parameters:
            - operator <type 'list'>: linear, hermitian matrix representing the quantum operator
            - theta_init <type 'float'>: initial value for the theta component of the quantum state (must be between 0.0 and pi/2)
            - phi_init <type 'float'>: initial value for the phi component of the quantum state (must be between 0.0 and pi/2)

        Returns:
            - [theta_updated, phi_updated] <type 'list'>: list storing the updated values for theta and phi after being operated on by 'operator'

        Example:
            >>> rc = RotationConversions()
            >>> pauli_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]] # pauli z gate
            >>> print(rc.operator_to_updated_state(pauli_z, 1, 1)) # operate on the initial state of ['theta': 1, 'phi': 1]

            - print_optimization_loss=False <type 'bool'>: boolean value that determines if the function will print out the loss of the tf model as it optimizes to find the spacial rotations
            - epochs=300 <type: 'int'>: number of epochs that the tf model will optimize for
            - num_of_vectors=3 <type 'int'>: number of quantum statevectors that the tf model will optimize for (higher means more accurate but slower, lower means less accurate but faster)

        Returns:
            - [RotX, RotY, RotZ] <type 'list'>: list storing the spacial rotations along each axis corresponding to the passed operator
