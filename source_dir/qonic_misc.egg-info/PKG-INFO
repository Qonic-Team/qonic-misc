        ## qonic-misc Python Library:
        Python library with miscellaneous tools to be used in conjunction with the qonic framework
        
        **To install:** `pip3 install qonic_misc`
        
        **Includes:**  
          * `qonic_misc.RotationConversions`: 
            * `operator_to_updated_state(operator, theta_init, phi_init)`
            
                **Description:**
                * this function takes a quantum operator (corresponding to a qbit gate), and the initial qbit state defined by the angles theta and phi
                * theta and phi define the state based on some point on the bloch sphere in spherical coordinates
                * the statevector of the qbit is defined as [*cos(theta/2)*, *sin(theta/2) e^(i phi)*]
                * the function returns the state after being acted on by the gate (in terms of the new theta and phi values)
        
                **Parameters:**
                * `operator <type 'list'>`: linear, hermitian matrix representing the quantum operator
                * `theta_init <type 'float'>`: initial value for the theta component of the quantum state (must be between 0.0 and pi/2)
                * `phi_init <type 'float'>`: initial value for the phi component of the quantum state (must be between 0.0 and pi/2)
        
                **Returns:**
                * `[theta_updated, phi_updated] <type 'list'>`: list storing the updated values for theta and phi after being operated on by 'operator'
        
                **Example:**
                
                    
                    >>> rc = qonic_misc.RotationConversions()
                    >>> pauli_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]] # pauli z gate
                    >>> print(rc.operator_to_updated_state(pauli_z, 1, 1)) # operate on the initial state of ['theta': 1, 'phi': 1]
                    [-1.0, 1.0]
                    
                    
                    
            * `operator_to_rotation(operator, print_optimization_loss=False, epochs=300, num_of_vectors=3)`
                **Description:**
                * this function takes a quantum operator (corresponding to a qbit gate)
                * the function uses tensorflow to find the spacial rotations along the x, y, and z axes of the bloch sphere that corresponds to the operator acting on a qbit state state
        
                **Parameters:**
                * `operator <type 'list'>`: linear, hermitian matrix representing the quantum operator
                * `print_optimization_loss=False <type 'bool'>`: boolean value that determines if the function will print out the loss of the tf model as it optimizes to find the spacial rotations
                * `epochs=300 <type: 'int'>`: number of epochs that the tf model will optimize for
                * `num_of_vectors=3 <type 'int'>`: number of quantum statevectors that the tf model will optimize for (higher means more accurate but slower, lower means less accurate but faster)
        
                **Returns:**
                * `[RotX, RotY, RotZ] <type 'list'>`: list storing the spacial rotations along each axis corresponding to the passed operator
        
                **Example:**
                
                    
                    >>> rc = qonic_misc.RotationConversions()
                    >>> pauli_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]] # pauli z gate
                    >>> print(rc.operator_to_rotation(pauli_z)) # solve for the spacial rotation of the pauli z gate
                    [0.0, 0.0, 3.14159]
                    
                    
                    
          * `qonic_misc.OperatorChecker`: tool for evaluating operators
            * `check_hermitian(operator)`
        
                **Description:**
                * this function takes a 2 by 2 operator matrix and checks to see if it is hermitian (equal to its transposed conjugate)
                * this is useful because all qbit operators corresponding to quantum logic gates must be hermitian
            
                **Parameters:**
                * `operator <type 'list'>`: matrix representing the quantum operator
                    
                **Returns:**
                * `hermitian <type 'bool'>`: boolean value storing if the passed matrix is hermitian
             
                **Example:**
                
                    >>> oc = qonic_misc.OperatorChecker
                    >>> pauli_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]] # pauli z gate
                    >>> print(oc.check_hermitian(pauli_z)) # check to see if the pauli z gate is hermitian
                    True
        
        
        
            * `check_unitary(operator)`
                
                **Description:**
                * this function takes a 2 by 2 operator matrix and checks to see if it is unitary (produces the identity matrix when multiplied by its transposed conjugate)
                * this is useful because all qbit operators corresponding to quantum logic gates must be unitary
                
                **Parameters:**
                * `operator <type 'list'>`: matrix representing the quantum operator
                    
                **Returns:**
                * `unitary <type 'bool'>`: boolean value storing if the passed matrix is unitary

                    >>> print(oc.check_unitary(pauli_z) # check to see if the pauli z gate is unitary
                    True
